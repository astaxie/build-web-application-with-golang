# Go development tools

In this section, I'm going to show you a few IDEs that can help you become a more efficient programmer, with capabilities such as intelligent code completion and auto-formatting. They are all cross-platform, so the steps I will be showing you should not be very different, even if you are not using the same operating system.

## LiteIDE

LiteIDE is an open source, lightweight IDE for developing Go projects only, developed by visualfc.

### LiteIDE installation

- Install LiteIDE
	- [Download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/liteide/files/)
	- [Source code](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide)
	
	You need to install Go first, then download the version appropriate for your operating system. Decompress the package to directly use it.
- Install gocode

	You have to install gocode in order to use intelligent completion
	
		go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
		
- Compilation environment

	Switch configuration in LiteIDE to suit your operating system.
	In Windows and using the 64-bit version of Go, you should choose win64 as the configuration environment in the tool bar. Then, choose `Options`, find `LiteEnv` in the left list and open file `win64.env` in the right list.
	
		GOROOT=c:\go
		GOBIN=
		GOARCH=amd64
		GOOS=windows
		CGO_ENABLED=1

		PATH=%GOBIN%;%GOROOT%\bin;%PATH%
		。。。
	
	Replace `GOROOT=c:\go` to your Go installation path, save it. If you have MinGW64, add `c:\MinGW64\bin` to your path environment variable for `cgo` support.
	
	In Linux and using the 64-bit version of Go, you should choose linux64 as the configuration environment in the tool bar. Then, choose `Options`, find `LiteEnv` in the left list and open the `linux64.env` file in the right list.
	
		GOROOT=$HOME/go
		GOBIN=
		GOARCH=amd64
		GOOS=linux
		CGO_ENABLED=1

		PATH=$GOBIN:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH   
		。。。
		
	Replace `GOROOT=$HOME/go` to your Go installation path, save it. 
- $GOPATH
	$GOPATH is the path that contains a list of projects. Open the command tool (or press ``Ctrl+` ``in LiteIDE), then type `go help gopath` for more details.
	It's very easy to view and change $GOPATH in LiteIDE. Follow `View - Setup GOPATH` to view and change these values.
	
## Sublime Text

Here I'm going to introduce you the Sublime Text 3 (Sublime for short) + GoSublime + gocode. Let me explain why.

- Intelligent completion

	![](images/1.4.sublime1.png?raw=true)
	
	Figure 1.5 Sublime intelligent completion
- Auto-format source files
- Project management

	![](images/1.4.sublime2.png?raw=true)
	
	Figure 1.6 Sublime project management
	
- Syntax highlight
- Free trial forever with no functional limitations. You may be prompted once in a while to remind you to purchase a license, but you can simply ignore it if you wish. Of course, if you do find that it enhances your productivity and you really enjoy using it, please purchase a copy of it and support its continued development!

First, download the version of [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) suitable for your operating system.

1. Press ``Ctrl+` ``, open the command tool and input the following commands.

 Applicable to Sublime Text 3：

```Go
import  urllib.request,os;pf='Package Control.sublime-package';ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();urllib.request.install_opener(urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.ProxyHandler()));open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib.request.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read())
```
  Applicable to Sublime Text 2：

```Go
import  urllib2,os;pf='Package Control.sublime-package';ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();os.makedirs(ipp)ifnotos.path.exists(ipp)elseNone;urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler()));open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read());print('Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation')
```
		
	Restart Sublime Text when the installation has finished. You should then find a `Package Control` option in the "Preferences" menu.
	
	![](images/1.4.sublime3.png?raw=true)
	
	Figure 1.7 Sublime Package Control
2. To install GoSublime, SidebarEnhancements and Go Build, press `Ctrl+Shift+p` to open Package Control, then type `pcip` (short for "Package Control: Install Package").

	![](images/1.4.sublime4.png?raw=true)
	
	Figure 1.8 Sublime Install Packages
	
	Now type in "GoSublime", press OK to install the package, and repeat the same steps for installing SidebarEnhancements and Go Build. Once again, restart the editor when it completes the installation.
3. To verify that the installation is successful, open Sublime, then open the `main.go` file to see if it has the proper syntax highlighting. Type `import` to see if code completion prompts appear. After typing `import "fmt"`, type `fmt.` anywhere after the `import` declaration to see whether or not intelligent code completion for functions was successfully enabled.

	If everything is fine, you're all set.
	
	If not, check your $PATH again. Open a terminal, type `gocode`. If it does not run, your $PATH was not configured correctly.
	
## Vim

Vim is a popular text editor for programmers, which evolved from its slimmer predecessor, Vi. It has functions for intelligent completion, compilation and jumping to errors.

vim-go is vim above an open-source go language using the most extensive development environment plug-ins

The plugin address：[github.com/fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)

Vim plugin management are the mainstream [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
，But the aspects thereof are different. 
Pathogen is to solve each plug-in after the installation of files scattered to multiple directories and poor management of the existence. Vundle is to solve the automatic search and download plug-ins exist.
These two plug-ins can be used simultaneously.

1.Install Vundle

```sh
mkdir ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Edit .vimrc，Vundle the relevant configuration will be placed in the beginning([Refer to the Vundle documentation for details](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim))

```sh
set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
filetype off                  " required

" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()

" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'

" All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
call vundle#end()            " required
filetype plugin indent on    " required

```
2.Install Vim-go

Edit ~/.vimrc，Add a line between vundle #begin and vundle #end：

```sh

Plugin 'fatih/vim-go'
```

Executed within Vim: PluginInstall

3.Install YCM(Your Complete Me) to AutoComplete
Add a line to ~ / .vimrc:
```sh

Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'
```
Executed within Vim: PluginInstall

Figure 1.8 Vim intelligent completion for Go

1. Syntax highlighting for Go

		cp -r $GOROOT/misc/vim/* ~/.vim/
		
2. Enabling syntax highlighting 

		filetype plugin indent on
		syntax on
		
3. Install [gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode/)

		go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
		
	gocode will be installed in `$GOBIN` as default

4. Configure [gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode/)

		~ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nsf/gocode/vim
		~ ./update.sh
		~ gocode set propose-builtins true
		propose-builtins true
		~ gocode set lib-path "/home/border/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64"
		lib-path "/home/border/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64"
		~ gocode set
		propose-builtins true
		lib-path "/home/border/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64"
		
	Explanation of gocode configuration:
	
	propose-builtins: specifies whether or not to open intelligent completion; false by default.
	lib-path: gocode only searches for packages in `$GOPATH/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH` and `$GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH`. This setting can be used to add additional paths.

5. Congratulations! Try `:e main.go` to experience the world of Go!

## Emacs

Emacs is the so-called Weapon of God. She is not only an editor, but also a powerful IDE.

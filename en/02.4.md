# Struct

## Basics of Struct

Struct can be used to define custom data types in Go. Often times, we can not handle the real world information using the standard data types which come with languages. While it is not impossible, it is highly inefficient. For example, in an eCommerce application, we have the ShoppingCart in which we put products for checkout.

type Product struct {
    name string
    itemID int
    cost float32
    isAvailable bool
    inventoryLeft int
}
	
There are a lot of attributes of Product, its name, the ID they refer to it internally, the cost, number of the products in stock etc.

- `name` is a `string` used to store a product's name.
- `itemID` is an `int` used to store for reference.
- `cost` is a `float32` of the item.
- `isAvailable` is a `bool` which is true if the item is in stock, false otherwise.
- `inventoryLeft` is an `int` of the number of products left in stock.

#### Initializing

	var goBook Product  // p is Product type
	goBook.name = "Webapps in Go"  
    // assign the "Webapps in Go" to the field 'name' of goBook
	goBook.itemID = 10025  // assign 10025 to field 'itemID' of p
	fmt.Printf("The product's name is %s\n", goBook.name)  
    // access field 'name' of goBook

There are three more ways to define a struct.

- Assign initial values by order

`goBook := Product{"Webapps in Go", 10025}`
	
- Use the format `field:value` to initialize the struct without order

`goBook := Product{name:"Webapps in Go", itemID:10025, cost:100}`

- Define an anonymous struct, then initialize it

`P := struct{name string; age int}{"Amy",18}`
		
Let's see a complete example.

file: `code/Struct/Book/struct.go`

	package main

    import "fmt"

    // Product will denote a physical object
    // which we will sell online to be rich
    type Product struct {
        name          string
        itemID        int
        cost          float32
        isAvailable   bool
        inventoryLeft int
    }

    func main() {
        var goBook Product

        // initialization
        goBook.name, goBook.itemID, goBook.isAvailable, goBook.inventoryLeft = "Webapps in Go", 10025, true, 25

        // initialize two values by format "field:value"
        pythonBook := Product{itemID: 10026, name: "Learn Python", inventoryLeft: 0, isAvailable: false}

        // initialize two values with order
        rubyBook := Product{"Learn Ruby", 10043, 100, true, 12}

        if goBook.isAvailable {
            fmt.Printf("%d copies of %s are available\n", 
            goBook.inventoryLeft, goBook.name)
        }

        if pythonBook.isAvailable {
            fmt.Printf("%d copies of %s are available\n", 
            pythonBook.inventoryLeft, pythonBook.name)
        }

        if rubyBook.isAvailable {
            fmt.Printf("%d copies of %s are available\n", 
            rubyBook.inventoryLeft, rubyBook.name)
        }

    }
	
#### embedded fields in struct

In the earlier chapter, we saw how toÂ define a struct with field names and type. Embedded fields can be thought of as subclass and superclass in Object oriented programming.

When the embedded field is a struct, all the fields in that struct will implicitly be the fields in the struct in which it has been embdedded.

Let's see one example.

file: `code/Struct/Human/human.go`

	package main
	import "fmt"

	type Human struct {
    	name string
    	age int
    	weight int
	}

	type Student struct {
    	Human  // embedded field, it means Student struct
		// includes all fields that Human has.
    	specialty string
	}

	func main() {
    	// initialize a student
    	mark := Student{Human{"Mark", 25, 120}, "Computer Science"}

    	// access fields
    	fmt.Println("His name is ", mark.name)
    	fmt.Println("His age is ", mark.age)
    	fmt.Println("His weight is ", mark.weight)
    	fmt.Println("His specialty is ", mark.specialty)
    	// modify notes
    	mark.specialty = "AI"
    	fmt.Println("Mark changed his specialty")
    	fmt.Println("His specialty is ", mark.specialty)
    	// modify age
    	fmt.Println("Mark become old")
    	mark.age = 46
    	fmt.Println("His age is", mark.age)
    	// modify weight
    	fmt.Println("Mark is not an athlete anymore")
    	mark.weight += 60
    	fmt.Println("His weight is", mark.weight)
	}
	
![Embedding in Student and Human](images/2.4.student_struct.png)

We see that we can access the `age` and `name` fields in Student just like we can in Human. This is how embedded fields work. We can even use Student to access Human in this embedded field!

	mark.Human = Human{"Marcus", 55, 220}
	mark.Human.age -= 1
	
All the types in Go can be used as embedded fields.

file: `code/Struct/Skills/skills.go`

	package main
	import "fmt"

	type Skills []string

	type Human struct {
    	name string
    	age int
    	weight int
	}

	type Student struct {
    	Human  // struct as embedded field
    	Skills // string slice as embedded field
    	int    // built-in type as embedded field
    	specialty string
	}

	func main() {
    	// initialize Student Jane
    	jane := Student{Human:Human{"Jane", 35, 100}, specialty:"Biology"}
    	// access fields
    	fmt.Println("Her name is ", jane.name)
    	fmt.Println("Her age is ", jane.age)
    	fmt.Println("Her weight is ", jane.weight)
    	fmt.Println("Her specialty is ", jane.specialty)
    	// modify value of skill field
    	jane.Skills = []string{"anatomy"}
    	fmt.Println("Her skills are ", jane.Skills)
    	fmt.Println("She acquired two new ones ")
    	jane.Skills = append(jane.Skills, "physics", "golang")
    	fmt.Println("Her skills now are ", jane.Skills)
    	// modify embedded field
    	jane.int = 3
    	fmt.Println("Her preferred number is ", jane.int)
	}
	
In the above example, we can see that all types can be embedded fields and we can use functions to operate on them.

When we embed Human inside Employee, if Human and Employee have the phone field, then it isn't a problem. Because we access Employee's phone as Employee.Phone, but since Human is an embedded field inside Employee, we access Human's phone as Employee.Human.Phone

file: `code/Struct/Employee/employee.go`

	package main
	import "fmt"

	type Human struct {
    	name string
    	age int
    	phone string  // Human has phone field
	}

	type Employee struct {
    	Human  // embedded field Human
    	specialty string
    	phone string  // phone in employee
	}

	func main() {
    	Bob := Employee{Human{"Bob", 34, "777-444-XXXX"}, 
		    "Designer", "333-222"}
    	fmt.Println("Bob's work phone is:", Bob.phone)
    	// access phone field in Human
    	fmt.Println("Bob's personal phone is:", Bob.Human.phone)
	}

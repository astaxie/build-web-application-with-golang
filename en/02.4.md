# 2.4 struct

## struct

We can define new types of containers of other properties or fields in Go just like in other programming languages. For example, we can create a type called `person` to represent a person, with fields name and age. We call this kind of type a `struct`.
```Go
type person struct {
	name string
	age int
}
```
Look how easy it is to define a `struct`!

There are two fields.

- `name` is a `string` used to store a person's name.
- `age` is a `int` used to store a person's age.

Let's see how to use it.
```Go
type person struct {
	name string
	age int
}

var P person  // p is person type

P.name = "Astaxie"  // assign "Astaxie" to the field 'name' of p
P.age = 25  // assign 25 to field 'age' of p
fmt.Printf("The person's name is %s\n", P.name)  // access field 'name' of p
```
There are three more ways to initialize a struct.

- Assign initial values by order
```Go
P := person{"Tom", 25}
```
- Use the format `field:value` to initialize the struct without order
```Go
P := person{age:24, name:"Bob"}
```
- Define an anonymous struct, then initialize it
```Go
P := struct{name string; age int}{"Amy",18}
```		
Let's see a complete example.

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

// define a new type
type person struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

// struct is passed by value
// compare the age of two people, then return the older person and differences of age
func Older(p1, p2 person) (person, int) {
	if p1.age > p2.age {
		return p1, p1.age - p2.age
	}
	return p2, p2.age - p1.age
}

func main() {
	var tom person

	tom.name, tom.age = "Tom", 18
	bob := person{age: 25, name: "Bob"}
	paul := person{"Paul", 43}

	tb_Older, tb_diff := Older(tom, bob)
	tp_Older, tp_diff := Older(tom, paul)
	bp_Older, bp_diff := Older(bob, paul)

	fmt.Printf("Of %s and %s, %s is older by %d years\n", tom.name, bob.name, tb_Older.name, tb_diff)
	fmt.Printf("Of %s and %s, %s is older by %d years\n", tom.name, paul.name, tp_Older.name, tp_diff)
	fmt.Printf("Of %s and %s, %s is older by %d years\n", bob.name, paul.name, bp_Older.name, bp_diff)
}
```
### embedded fields in struct

I've just introduced to you how to define a struct with field names and type. In fact, Go supports fields without names, but with types. We call these embedded fields.

When the embedded field is a struct, all the fields in that struct will implicitly be the fields in the struct in which it has been embedded.

Let's see one example.
```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type Human struct {
	name   string
	age    int
	weight int
}

type Student struct {
	Human     // embedded field, it means Student struct includes all fields that Human has.
	specialty string
}

func main() {
	// instantiate and initialize a student
	mark := Student{Human{"Mark", 25, 120}, "Computer Science"}

	// access fields
	fmt.Println("His name is ", mark.name)
	fmt.Println("His age is ", mark.age)
	fmt.Println("His weight is ", mark.weight)
	fmt.Println("His specialty is ", mark.specialty)

	// modify mark's specialty
	mark.specialty = "AI"
	fmt.Println("Mark changed his specialty")
	fmt.Println("His specialty is ", mark.specialty)

	fmt.Println("Mark become old. He is not an athlete anymore")
	mark.age = 46
	mark.weight += 60
	fmt.Println("His age is", mark.age)
	fmt.Println("His weight is", mark.weight)
}

```

Figure 2.7 Embedding in Student and Human

We see that we can access the `age` and `name` fields in Student just like we can in Human. This is how embedded fields work. It's very cool, isn't it? Hold on, there's  something cooler! You can even use Student to access Human in this embedded field!
```Go
mark.Human = Human{"Marcus", 55, 220}
mark.Human.age -= 1
```
All the types in Go can be used as embedded fields.
```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type Skills []string

type Human struct {
	name   string
	age    int
	weight int
}

type Student struct {
	Human     // struct as embedded field
	Skills    // string slice as embedded field
	int       // built-in type as embedded field
	specialty string
}

func main() {
	// initialize Student Jane
	jane := Student{Human: Human{"Jane", 35, 100}, specialty: "Biology"}
	// access fields
	fmt.Println("Her name is ", jane.name)
	fmt.Println("Her age is ", jane.age)
	fmt.Println("Her weight is ", jane.weight)
	fmt.Println("Her specialty is ", jane.specialty)
	// modify value of skill field
	jane.Skills = []string{"anatomy"}
	fmt.Println("Her skills are ", jane.Skills)
	fmt.Println("She acquired two new ones ")
	jane.Skills = append(jane.Skills, "physics", "golang")
	fmt.Println("Her skills now are ", jane.Skills)
	// modify embedded field
	jane.int = 3
	fmt.Println("Her preferred number is ", jane.int)
}

```
In the above example, we can see that all types can be embedded fields and we can use functions to operate on them.

There is one more problem however. If Human has a field called `phone` and Student has a field with same name, what should we do?

Go use a very simple way to solve it. The outer fields get upper access levels, which means when you access `student.phone`, we will get the field called phone in student, not the one in the Human struct. This feature can be simply seen as field `overloading`.
```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type Human struct {
	name  string
	age   int
	phone string // Human has phone field
}

type Employee struct {
	Human
	specialty string
	phone     string // phone in employee
}

func main() {
	Bob := Employee{Human{"Bob", 34, "777-444-XXXX"}, "Designer", "333-222"}

	fmt.Println("Bob's work phone is:", Bob.phone)
	fmt.Println("Bob's personal phone is:", Bob.Human.phone)
}

# 6.5 Summary

In this chapter, we learned about the definition and purpose of sessions and cookies, and the relationship between the two. Since Go doesn't support sessions in its standard library, we also designed our own session manager. We went through everything from creating client sessions to deleting them. We then defined an interface called `Provider` which supports all session storage structures. In section 6.3, we implemented a memory based session manager to persist client data across sessions. In section 6.4, I demonstrated one way of hijacking a session. Then we looked at how to prevent your own sessions from being hijacked. I hope that you now understand most of the working principles behind sessions so that you're able to safely use them in your applications.

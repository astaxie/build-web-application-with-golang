# 1 Go Environment Configuration

Welcome to the world of Go, let's start exploring!

Go is a fast-compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent systems programming language. It has the following advantages:

- Compiles a large project within a few seconds.
- Provides a software development model that is easy to reason about, avoiding most of the problems that caused by C-style header files.
- Is a static language that does not have levels in its type system, so users do not need to spend much time dealing with relations between types. It is more like a lightweight object-oriented language.
- Performs garbage collection. It provides basic support for concurrency and communication.
- Designed for multi-core computers.

Go is a compiled language. It combines the development efficiency of interpreted or dynamic languages with the security of static languages. It is going to be the language of choice for the modern multi-core computers with networking. For these purposes, there are some problems that have to be resolved in language itself, such as a richly expressive lightweight type system, concurrency, and strictly regulated garbage collection. For quite some time, no packages or tools have come out that have solved all of these problems pragmatically; thus was born the motivation for the Go language.

In this chapter, I will show you how to install and configure your own Go development environment.

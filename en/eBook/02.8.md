# 2.8 Summary

In this chapter, we mainly introduced the 25 Go keywords. Let's review what they are and what they do.

	break    default      func    interface    select
	case     defer        go      map          struct
	chan     else         goto    package      switch
	const    fallthrough  if      range        type
	continue for          import  return       var
	
- `var` and `const` are used to define variables and constants.
- `package` and `import` are for package use.
- `func` is used to define functions and methods.
- `return` is used to return values in functions or methods.
- `defer` is used to define defer functions.
- `go` is used to start a new goroutine.
- `select` is used to switch over multiple channels for communication.
- `interface` is used to define interfaces.
- `struct` is used to define special customized types.
- `break`, `case`, `continue`, `for`, `fallthrough`, `else`, `if`, `switch`, `goto`, `default` were introduced in section 2.3.
- `chan` is the type of channel for communication among goroutines.
- `type` is used to define customized types.
- `map` is used to define map which is like hash table in others languages.
- `range` is used for reading data from `slice`, `map` and `channel`.

If you understand how to use these 25 keywords, you've learned a lot of Go already.

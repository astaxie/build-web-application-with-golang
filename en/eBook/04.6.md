# 4.6 Summary

In this chapter, we mainly learned how to process form data in Go through examples about user log in and file upload. We also understand that verify user data is extremely important for website security, and we used one section to talk about how to filter data with regular expression.

I hope you know more about communication between client and server side, which is client sends data to server, and server responds to client after processed data.

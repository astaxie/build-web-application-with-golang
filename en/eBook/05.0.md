# 5 Database

For web developers, the database is at the core of web development. You can save almost anything into a database and query or update data inside it, like user information, products or news articles.

Go doesn't provide any database drivers, but it does have a driver interface defined in the `database/sql` package. People can develop database drivers based on that interface. In section 5.1, we are going to talk about database driver interface design in Go; in sections 5.2 to 5.4, I will introduce some SQL database drivers to you; in section 5.5, i'll present the ORMã€€that i've developed which is based on the `database/sql` interface standard. It's compatible with most drivers that have implemented the `database/sql` interface, and it makes it easy to access databases idiomatically in Go.

NoSQL has been a hot topic in recent years. More websites are deciding to use NoSQL databases as their main database instead of just for the purpose of caching. I will introduce you to two NoSQL databases, which are MongoDB and Redis, in section 5.6.

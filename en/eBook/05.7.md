# 5.7 Summary

In this chapter, you first learned the design of `database/sql` interface, and many third-party database drivers for different kinds of database. Then I introduced beedb to you, an ORM for relational databases, also showed some samples for operating database. In the end, I talked about some NoSQL databases, I have to see Go gives very good support for those NoSQL databases.

After read this chapter, I hope you know how to operate databases in Go. This is the most important part in web development, so I want to you completely understand design ideas of `database/sql` interface.

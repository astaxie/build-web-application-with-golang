# 6.5 Summary

In this chapter, we learned what is session and what is cookie, and the relationship between them. And because Go doesn't support session in standard library, so we designed a session manager, go through the whole processes from create session to delete session. Then we defined a interface called `Procider` which supports for all session storage structures. In section 6.3, we implemented a session manager that use memory to save data. In section 6.4, I showed you how to hijack session and the way to prevent session hijack. I hope you know all the working principles of session in order to use session by safer way.

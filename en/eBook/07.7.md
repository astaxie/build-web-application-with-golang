# 7.7 Summary

In this chapter, we introduced some text process tools like XML, JSON, Regexp and template. XML and JSON are data exchange tools, if you can represent almost all kinds of information though these two formats. Regexp is a powerful tool for searching, replacing, cutting text content. With template, you can easily combine dynamic data with static files. These tools are all useful when you develop web application, I hope you understand more about processing and showing content.

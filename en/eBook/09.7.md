# 9.7 Summary

This chapter describes as: CSRF attacks, XSS attacks, SQL injection attacks, etc. Some Web applications typical methods of attack, they are due to the application on the user's input filter cause no good, so in addition to introduce the method of attack in addition, we have also introduced how to effectively carry out data filtering to prevent these attacks occurrence. Then the password for the day iso serious spill, introduced in the design of Web applications can be used from basic to expert encryption scheme. Finally encryption and decryption of sensitive data brief, Go language provides three symmetric encryption algorithms: base64, AES and DES implementation.

The purpose of writing this chapter is to enhance the reader to the concept of security in the consciousness inside, when the Web application in the preparation of a little more carefully, so that we can write Web applications away from hackers attacks. Go language has been in support of a large anti-attack toolkit, we can take full advantage of these packages to make a secure Web applications.

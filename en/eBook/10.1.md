## What is the Locale

Locale is a set of descriptors in the world in a particular region and language habits text format collection of settings. locale name is usually composed of three parts: The first part is a mandatory, which means that the language abbreviation, such as "en" for English or "zh" represents Chinese. The second part, followed by an underscore, the country is an optional specifier, speak the same language is used to distinguish between different countries, such as "en_US" for U.S. English, and "en_UK" represents British English. The last part, followed by a period after the optional character set specifiers, such as "zh_CN.gb2312" said the Chinese use the gb2312 character set.

GO language defaults to "UTF-8" encoding set, so we realize i18n does not consider the third part, then we have adopted the locale description of the previous two sections as i18n standard locale name.

> On Linux and Solaris systems can `locale -a` command lists all supported regional name, the reader can see these areas naming names. For BSD and other systems, there is no locale command, but the regional information is stored in `/usr/share/locale`.

## Set the Locale

With the face of the locale definition, then we need according to the user's information( access to information, personal information, access to domain names, etc.) to set the associated locale, we can use the following several ways to set the user's locale.

### Set Locale by domain name

Set Locale way this is used when the application is running domain hierarchical manner, for example, we have adopted as our English www.asta.com station( the default station), and the domain name www.asta.cn as a Chinese station. By application of this domain name and set up inside the correspondence between the respective locale, you can set up regions. This treatment has several advantages:

- Via a URL can be very distinctive identification
- Users can be very intuitive to know the domain name will be visiting the site in that language
- Go program is implemented in a very simple and convenient, can be achieved through a map
- Conducive to search engine crawlers can improve the site's SEO

We can use the following code to implement a corresponding domain name locale:

	if r.Host == "www.asta.com" {
		i18n.SetLocale("en")
	} else if r.Host == "www.asta.cn" {
		i18n.SetLocale("zh-CN")
	} else if r.Host == "www.asta.tw" {
		i18n.SetLocale("zh-TW")
	}

Of course, in addition to the entire domain settings outside the region, we can also be set through the sub-domain areas, such as "en.asta.com" for English sites, "cn.asta.com" indicates Chinese site. Realization of the code is as follows:

	prefix:= strings.Split(r.Host,".")

	if prefix[0] == "en" {
		i18n.SetLocale("en")
	} else if prefix[0] == "cn" {
		i18n.SetLocale("zh-CN")
	} else if prefix[0] == "tw" {
		i18n.SetLocale("zh-TW")
	}

Locale setting by domain name as shown above advantages, but we generally do not develop Web applications, when used in this way, because first of all domain names cost is relatively high, the development of a Locale need a domain name, and often the name of the domain does not necessarily uniform apply to, and secondly we do not want to go to each site localization of a configuration, but more is to use the url method with parameters, see the following description.

### Locale parameter settings from the domain name

The most common way is to set the Locale to bring inside in the URL parameters, such `www.asta.com/hello?locale=zh` or `www.asta.com/zh/hello`. So that we can set the region: `i18n.SetLocale(params["locale"])`.

This setup has almost speaking in front of the domain name Locale setting all the advantages, it uses a RESTful way, so we do not need to add additional methods to deal with. However, this approach requires a link inside each one corresponding increase in the parameter locale, this may be a bit complicated and sometimes quite cumbersome. However, we can write a generic function that url, so that all the link addresses are generated through this function, then this function which increases `locale = params [" locale "]` parameter to alleviate it.

Maybe we want to look more RESTful URL address that, for example: `www.asta.com/en/books` (English site) and `www.asta.com/zh/books` (Chinese site), this approach is more conducive to the URL SEO, but also more friendly for the user, can be accessed through the URL of the site that intuitive. Then such a URL address to get through router locale(reference section which describes the router REST plug-in implementation):

	mux.Get("/:locale/books", listbook)

### From the client settings area

In some special cases, we need the client's information rather than through the URL to set Locale, such information may come from the client to set the preferred language( the browser settings), the user's IP address, the user at the time of registration fill the location information. This approach is more suitable for Web -based applications.

- Accept-Language

When a client requests information in the HTTP header there `Accept-Language`, clients will generally set this information, the following is the Go language to achieve a simple `Accept-Language` under implementation sets the region code:

	AL := r.Header.Get("Accept-Language")
	if AL == "en" {
		i18n.SetLocale("en")
	} else if AL == "zh-CN" {
		i18n.SetLocale("zh-CN")
	} else if AL == "zh-TW" {
		i18n.SetLocale("zh-TW")
	}

Of course, in practical applications, it may require more rigorous judgment to be set area
- IP Address

Another set of the client area is the user access IP, we according to the corresponding IP library, corresponding to the IP access to areas of the world that is more commonly used GeoIP Lite Country this library. This setting regional mechanism is very simple, we only need to check the user's IP IP database and then return to the country regions, according to the results returned by setting the corresponding regions.

- User profile

Of course, you can also let users provide you with drop-down menus or whatever way set the appropriate locale, then we have the information entered by the user, it is saved to the account associated with the profile, when the user login again, this time to set up replicated to the locale setting, so that you can guarantee that every time the user accesses are based on their previously set locale to get the page.

## Summary

Through the above description shows that you can set the Locale There are many ways that we should be selected according to the different needs of different settings Locale way to allow a user to its most familiar way to get the services we provide, improve application user friendliness.

# 10.2 Localized Resources

The previous section we describe how to set Locale, Locale set then we need to address the problem is how to store the information corresponding to the appropriate Locale it? This inside information includes: text messages, time and date, currency values ​​, pictures, include files, and view other resources. So then we are talking about information on eleven of these are described, Go language we put these information is stored in JSON format, and then through the appropriate way to show it. (Followed by Chinese and English contrast for example, the storage format en.json and zh-CN.json)

## Localized text messages

This information is most commonly used for writing Web applications, but also localized resources in the most information, you want to fit the local language way to display text information, a feasible solution is: Create a map corresponding to the language needed to maintain a key-value relationship, before the output needed to go from a suitable map for the corresponding text in the following is a simple example:

	package main

	import "fmt"

	var locales map[string]map[string]string

	func main() {
		locales = make(map[string]map[string]string, 2)
		en := make(map[string]string, 10)
		en["pea"] = "pea"
		en["bean"] = "bean"
		locales["en"] = en
		cn := make(map[string]string, 10)
		cn["pea"] = "豌豆"
		cn["bean"] = "毛豆"
		locales["zh-CN"] = cn
		lang := "zh-CN"
		fmt.Println(msg(lang, "pea"))
		fmt.Println(msg(lang, "bean"))
	}

	func msg(locale, key string) string {
		if v, ok := locales[locale]; ok {
			if v2, ok := v[key]; ok {
				return v2
			}
		}
		return ""
	}

The above example demonstrates a different locale text translation to achieve the Chinese and English for the same key display different language implementation, to achieve the above Chinese text message, if you want to switch to the English version, just need to set to en lang.

Sometimes only a key-value substitution is not meet the need, for example, "I am 30 years old", Chinese expression "I am 30 years old," and where 30 is a variable, how to do it? This time, we can combine `fmt.Printf` function to achieve, see the following code:

	en["how old"] = "I am %d years old"
	cn["how old"] = "我今年%d岁了"

	fmt.Printf(msg(lang, "how old"), 30)

The above example code is only to demonstrate the internal implementations, but the actual data is stored in the JSON inside, so we can `json.Unmarshal` to populate the data for the corresponding map.

## Localized date and time

Because the relationship between time zones, the same time, in different regions, which means that is not the same, but because of the relationship between Locale and time formats are not the same, for example, Chinese environment may be displayed: 
`October 24, 2012 Wednesday 23:11 minutes and 13 seconds CST`, while in the English environment may show: `Wed Oct 24 23:11:13 CST 2012`. That which we need to address two points:

1. time zones
2. formatting issues

`$GOROOT/lib/time/package/timeinfo.zip` contain locale corresponds to the time zone definition, in order to obtain a time corresponding to the current locale, we should first use `time.LoadLocation (name string)` Get the region corresponding to the locale, such as `Asia/Shanghai` or `America/Chicago` corresponding to the time zone information, and then use this information to call the `time.Now` time object obtained collaborate to get the final time. Detailed Look at the following example (this example uses the example above, some of the variables):

	en["time_zone"] = "America/Chicago"
	cn["time_zone"] = "Asia/Shanghai"

	loc, _ := time.LoadLocation(msg(lang, "time_zone"))
	t := time.Now()
	t = t.In(loc)
	fmt.Println(t.Format(time.RFC3339))

We can handle text format similar way to solve the problem of time format, for example as follows:

	en["date_format"]="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
	cn["date_format"]="%Y年%m月%d日 %H时%M分%S秒"

	fmt.Println(date(msg(lang,"date_format"),t))

	func date(fomate string,t time.Time) string{
		year, month, day = t.Date()
		hour, min, sec = t.Clock()
		//Parsing the corresponding %Y%m%d%H%M%S and then return information
		//%Y replaced by 2012
		//%m replaced by 10
		//%d replaced by 24
	}

## Localized currency value

Various regions of the currency is not the same, is also treated with a date about the details see the following code:

	en["money"] ="USD %d"
	cn["money"] ="￥%d元"

	fmt.Println(date(msg(lang,"date_format"),100))

	func money_format(fomate string,money int64) string{
		return fmt.Sprintf(fomate,money)
	}


## Localization views and resources

We may use Locale to show different views that contain different images, css, js and other static resources. So how to deal with these information? First we shall locale to organize file information, see the following file directory Arrangement:

	views
	|--en  //English Templates
		|--images     //store picture information
		|--js         //JS files 
		|--css        //CSS files
		index.tpl     //User Home
		login.tpl     //Log Home
	|--zh-CN //Chinese Templates
		|--images
		|--js
		|--css
		index.tpl
		login.tpl

With this directory structure we can render to realize where this code:

	s1, _ := template.ParseFiles("views" + lang + "index.tpl")
	VV.Lang = lang
	s1.Execute(os.Stdout, VV)

As for the inside of the resources inside the index.tpl set as follows:

	// js file
	<script type="text/javascript" src="views/{{.VV.Lang}}/js/jquery/jquery-1.8.0.min.js"></script>
	// css file
	<link href="views/{{.VV.Lang}}/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
	// Picture files
	<img src="views/{{.VV.Lang}}/images/btn.png">

With this view, and the way to localize the resources, we can easily be expanded.

## Summary

This section describes how to use and store local resources, sometimes through the conversion function to achieve, sometimes through lang to set up, but eventually through key-value way to store Locale corresponding data when needed remove the corresponding Locale information, if it is a text message directly to the output, if it is the date and time or money, you need to pass `fmt.Printf` or other formatting function to deal with, and for different views and resources Locale is the most simple, as long as increase in the path which can be achieved lang.

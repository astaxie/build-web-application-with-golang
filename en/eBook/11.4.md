# 11.4 Summary

In this chapter we were introduced through three subsections Go language how to handle errors, how to design error handling, and then a second section describes how to GDB debugger GDB we can single-step through the debugger, you can view variables, modify variables, print implementation process, etc. Finally, we describe how to use the Go language comes with a lightweight frame `testing` to write unit tests and stress tests, the use of `go test` you can easily perform these tests allow us in the future to modify the code after upgrade very convenient for regression testing. Perhaps for this chapter you write application logic without any help, but for you to write out the program code is essential to maintain high quality, because a good Web application must have good error handling mechanism(error of friendly, scalability), there is a good unit testing and stress testing to ensure on-line after the code is able to maintain good performance and runs as expected.

# 12.3 Deployment

After completion of the development program, we now want to deploy Web applications, but how do we deploy these applications do ? Because after compiling Go programs is an executable file, written a C program using daemon readers must know you can achieve the perfect background program runs continuously, but still not perfect at present Go realization daemon, therefore, for a Go application deployment, we can use third-party tools to manage, there are many third-party tools, such as Supervisord, upstart, daemon tools, etc. This section describes my own system using current tools Supervisord.

## Daemon

Currently Go programs can not be achieved daemon, see the Go detailed language bug: <`http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=227`>, probably mean that it is difficult from the the use of existing fork a thread out, because there is no simple way to ensure that all the threads have used state consistency problem.

But we can see some implementations daemon many online methods, such as the following two ways:

- MarGo an implementation of the idea of using Command to run their own applications, if you really want to achieve, it is recommended that such programs

<pre>
	d := flag.Bool("d", false, "Whether or not to launch in the background(like a daemon)")
	if *d {
		cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0],
			"-close-fds",
			"-addr", *addr,
			"-call", *call,
		)
		serr, err := cmd.StderrPipe()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalln(err)
		}
		err = cmd.Start()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalln(err)
		}
		s, err := ioutil.ReadAll(serr)
		s = bytes.TrimSpace(s)
		if bytes.HasPrefix(s, []byte("addr: ")) {
			fmt.Println(string(s))
			cmd.Process.Release()
		} else {
			log.Printf("unexpected response from MarGo: `%s` error: `%v`\n", s, err)
			cmd.Process.Kill()
		}
	}
</pre>

- Another solution is to use the syscall, but this solution is not perfect:

<pre>
	package main
	 
	import (
		"log"
		"os"
		"syscall"
	)
	 
	func daemon(nochdir, noclose int) int {
		var ret, ret2 uintptr
		var err uintptr
	 
		darwin := syscall.OS == "darwin"
	 
		// already a daemon
		if syscall.Getppid() == 1 {
			return 0
		}
	 
		// fork off the parent process
		ret, ret2, err = syscall.RawSyscall(syscall.SYS_FORK, 0, 0, 0)
		if err != 0 {
			return -1
		}
	 
		// failure
		if ret2 < 0 {
			os.Exit(-1)
		}
	 
		// handle exception for darwin
		if darwin && ret2 == 1 {
			ret = 0
		}
	 
		// if we got a good PID, then we call exit the parent process.
		if ret > 0 {
			os.Exit(0)
		}
	 
		/* Change the file mode mask */
		_ = syscall.Umask(0)
	 
		// create a new SID for the child process
		s_ret, s_errno := syscall.Setsid()
		if s_errno != 0 {
			log.Printf("Error: syscall.Setsid errno: %d", s_errno)
		}
		if s_ret < 0 {
			return -1
		}
	 
		if nochdir == 0 {
			os.Chdir("/")
		}
	 
		if noclose == 0 {
			f, e := os.OpenFile("/dev/null", os.O_RDWR, 0)
			if e == nil {
				fd := f.Fd()
				syscall.Dup2(fd, os.Stdin.Fd())
				syscall.Dup2(fd, os.Stdout.Fd())
				syscall.Dup2(fd, os.Stderr.Fd())
			}
		}
	 
		return 0
	}
</pre>

The above proposed two implementations Go's daemon program, but I still do not recommend you to realize this, because the official announcement has not officially support daemon, of course, the first option is more feasible for now, but it is currently open source library skynet in adopting this program do daemon.

## Supervisord

Go has been described above, there are two options currently are to realize his daemon, but the government itself does not support this one, so it is recommended that you use sophisticated tools to manage our third-party applications, here I'll give you a present more extensive use of process management software: Supervisord. Supervisord is implemented in Python a very useful process management tool. supervisord will help you to manage applications into daemon process, but can be easily turned on via the command, shut down, restart, etc, and it is managed by the collapse will automatically restart once the process so that you can ensure that the program execution is interrupted in the case there are self-healing capabilities.

> I stepped in front of a pit in the application, because all applications are made Supervisord parent born, then when you change the operating system file descriptor after, do not forget to restart Supervisord, light restart following application program useless. I just had the system installed after the first installed Supervisord, then start the deployment process, modify the file descriptor, restart the program, that the file descriptor is already 100,000, but in fact Supervisord this time or the default 1024, led him to manage the process All descriptors is 1024. pressure after opening up the system to start a newspaper run out of file descriptors, search for a long time to find the pit.

### Supervisord installation

Supervisord can `sudo easy_install supervisor` installation, of course, can also Supervisord official website to download, unzip and go to the folder where the source code, run `setup.py install` to install.

- Must be installed using easy_install setuptools

Open the `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools# files`, depending on your system version of python download the appropriate file, and then execute `sh setuptoolsxxxx.egg`, so that you can use easy_install command to install Supervisord.

### Supervisord Configure

Supervisord default configuration file path is `/etc/supervisord.conf`, through a text editor to modify this file, the following is a sample configuration file:

	;/etc/supervisord.conf
	[unix_http_server]
	file = /var/run/supervisord.sock
	chmod = 0777
	chown= root:root

	[inet_http_server]
	# Web management interface settings
	port=9001
	username = admin
	password = yourpassword

	[supervisorctl]
	; Must 'unix_http_server' match the settings inside
	serverurl = unix:///var/run/supervisord.sock

	[supervisord]
	logfile=/var/log/supervisord/supervisord.log ; (main log file;default $CWD/supervisord.log)
	logfile_maxbytes=50MB       ; (max main logfile bytes b4 rotation;default 50MB)
	logfile_backups=10          ; (num of main logfile rotation backups;default 10)
	loglevel=info               ; (log level;default info; others: debug,warn,trace)
	pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid ; (supervisord pidfile;default supervisord.pid)
	nodaemon=true              ; (start in foreground if true;default false)
	minfds=1024                 ; (min. avail startup file descriptors;default 1024)
	minprocs=200                ; (min. avail process descriptors;default 200)
	user=root                 ; (default is current user, required if root)
	childlogdir=/var/log/supervisord/            ; ('AUTO' child log dir, default $TEMP)

	[rpcinterface:supervisor]
	supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface
	; Manage the configuration of a single process, you can add multiple program
	[program: blogdemon]
	command =/data/blog/blogdemon
	autostart = true
	startsecs = 5
	user = root
	redirect_stderr = true
	stdout_logfile =/var/log/supervisord/blogdemon.log

### Supervisord management

After installation is complete, there are two Supervisord available command line supervisor and supervisorctl, command explained as follows:

- Supervisord, initial startup Supervisord, start, set in the configuration management process.
- Supervisorctl stop programxxx, stop one process(programxxx), programxxx for the [program: blogdemon] in configured value, this example is blogdemon.
- Supervisorctl start programxxx, start a process
- Supervisorctl restart programxxx, restarting a process
- Supervisorctl stop all, stop all processes, Note: start, restart, stop will not load the latest configuration files.
- Supervisorctl reload, load the latest configuration file, and press the new configuration to start, manage all processes.

## Summary

This section we describe how to implement daemon of the Go, but due to the current lack of Go-daemon implementation, need to rely on third-party tools to achieve the application daemon management approach, so here describes a process using python to write management tools Supervisord by Supervisord can easily put our Go up and application management.

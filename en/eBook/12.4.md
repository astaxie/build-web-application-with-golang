# 12.4 Backup and recovery

This section we discuss another aspect of application management: production server data backup and recovery. We often encounter the production server network is broken, bad hard drive, operating system crash, or if the database is unavailable a variety of unusual circumstances, so maintenance personnel need to produce applications and data on the server to do remote disaster recovery, cold prepare hot standby ready. In the next presentation, explained how the backup application, how to backup/restore MySQL database and Redis databases.

## Application Backup

In most cluster environment, Web applications, the basic need for backup, because this is actually a copy of the code, we are in the local development environment, or the version control system has to maintain the code. But many times, a number of development sites require users to upload files, then we need for these users to upload files for backup. In fact, now there is a suitable approach is to put the needs and site-related files stored on the storage to the cloud storage, so even if the system crashes, as long as we still cloud file storage, at least the data is not lost.

If we do not adopt cloud storage case, how to do a backup site do ? Here we introduce a file synchronization tool rsync: rsync backup site can be achieved in different file system synchronization, If the windows, then, need windows version cwrsync.

### Rsync installation

rsync 's official website: http://rsync.samba.org/can get the latest version from the above source. Of course, because rsync is a very useful software, so many Linux distributions will include it, including the.

Package Installation

	# sudo apt-get install rsync ; Note: debian, ubuntu and other online installation methods ;
	# yum install rsync ; Note: Fedora, Redhat, CentOS and other online installation methods ;
	# rpm -ivh rsync ; Note: Fedora, Redhat, CentOS and other rpm package installation methods ;

Other Linux distributions, please use the appropriate package management methods to install. Installing source packages

	tar xvf rsync-xxx.tar.gz
	cd rsync-xxx
	./configure - prefix =/usr; make; make install 
	
<blockquote>Note: Before using source packages compiled and installed, you have to install gcc compiler tools such as job</blockquote>

### Rsync Configure

rsync mainly in the following three configuration files rsyncd.conf( main configuration file ), rsyncd.secrets( password file ), rsyncd.motd(rysnc server information ).

Several documents about this configuration we can refer to the official website or other websites rsync introduction, here the server and client how to open

- Services client opens:

	`# /usr/bin/rsync --daemon --config=/etc/rsyncd.conf`

- daemon parameter approach is to run rsync in server mode. Join the rsync boot

	`echo 'rsync - daemon' >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local`

Set rsync password

	echo 'Your Username: Your Password' > /etc/rsyncd.secrets
	chmod 600 /etc/rsyncd.secrets

- Client synchronization:

Clients can use the following command to synchronize the files on the server:

	rsync -avzP --delete --password-file=rsyncd.secrets username@192.168.145.5::www/var/rsync/backup

This command, briefly explain a few points:

1. `-avzP` is what the reader can use the `-help` Show
2. `-delete` for example A, deleted a file, the time synchronization, B will automatically delete the corresponding files
3. `-Password-file` client/etc/rsyncd.secrets set password, and server to `/etc/rsyncd.secrets` the password the same, so cron is running, you do not need the password
4. This command in the " User Name" for the service side of the `/etc/rsyncd.secrets` the user name
5. This command 192.168.145.5 as the IP address of the server
6. :: www, note the two: number, www as a server configuration file `/etc/rsyncd.conf` in [www], meaning that according to the service on the client `/etc/rsyncd.conf` to synchronize them [www] paragraph, a: number, when used according to the configuration file does not directly specify the directory synchronization.

In order to synchronize real-time, you can set the crontab, keeping rsync synchronization every minute, of course, users can also set the level of importance depending on the file type of synchronization frequency.

## MySQL backup

MySQL database application is still the mainstream, the current MySQL backup in two ways: hot backup and cold backup, hot backup is currently mainly used master/slave mode (master/slave) mode is mainly used for database synchronization separate read and write, but also can be used for hot backup data ), on how to configure this information, we can find a lot. Cold backup data, then that is a certain delay, but you can guarantee that the time period before data integrity, such as may sometimes be caused by misuse of our loss of data, then the master/slave model is able to retrieve lost data, but through cold backup can partially restore the data.

Cold backup shell script is generally used to achieve regular backup of the database, and then rsync synchronization through the above described non-local one server room.

The following is a scheduled backup MySQL backup script, we use the mysqldump program, this command can be exported to a database file.


	#!/bin/bash
	# The following configuration information, modify their own
	mysql_user="USER" #MySQL backup user
	mysql_password="PASSWORD" # MySQL backup user's password
	mysql_host="localhost"
	mysql_port="3306"
	mysql_charset="utf8" # MySQL coding
	backup_db_arr=("db1" "db2") # To back up the database name, separated by spaces separated by a plurality of such("db1" "db2" "db3")
	backup_location=/var/www/mysql # backup data storage location, please do not end with a "/", this can keep the default, the program will automatically create a folder
	expire_backup_delete="ON" # delete outdated backups is turned OFF to ON ON to OFF
	expire_days=3 # default expiration time for the three days the number of days, this is only valid when the expire_backup_delete open

	# We do not need to modify the following start
	backup_time=`date +%Y%m%d%H%M` # define detailed time backup
	backup_Ymd=`date +%Y-%m-%d` # define the backup directory date time
	backup_3ago=`date-d '3 days ago '+%Y-%m-%d` # 3 days before the date
	backup_dir=$backup_location/$backup_Ymd # full path to the backup folder
	welcome_msg="Welcome to use MySQL backup tools!" # greeting

	# Determine whether to start MYSQL, mysql does not start the backup exit
	mysql_ps=`ps-ef | grep mysql | wc-l`
	mysql_listen=`netstat-an | grep LISTEN | grep $mysql_port | wc-l`
	if [[$mysql_ps==0]-o [$mysql_listen==0]]; then
	  echo "ERROR: MySQL is not running! backup stop!"
	  exit
	else
	  echo $welcome_msg
	fi

	# Connect to mysql database, can not connect to the backup exit
	mysql-h $mysql_host-P $mysql_port-u $mysql_user-p $mysql_password << end
	use mysql;
	select host, user from user where user='root' and host='localhost';
	exit
	end

	flag=`echo $?`
	if [$flag!="0"]; then
	  echo "ERROR: Can't connect mysql server! backup stop!"
	  exit
	else
	  echo "MySQL connect ok! Please wait......"
	   # Judgment does not define the backup database, if you define a backup is started, otherwise exit the backup
	  if ["$backup_db_arr"!=""]; then
		   # dbnames=$(cut-d ','-f1-5 $backup_database)
		   # echo "arr is(${backup_db_arr [@]})"
		  for dbname in ${backup_db_arr [@]}
		  do
			  echo "database $dbname backup start..."
			  `mkdir -p $backup_dir`
			  `mysqldump -h $mysql_host -P $mysql_port -u $mysql_user -p $mysql_password $dbname - default-character-set=$mysql_charset | gzip> $backup_dir/$dbname -$backup_time.sql.gz`
			  flag=`echo $?`
			  if [$flag=="0"]; then
				  echo "database $dbname success backup to $backup_dir/$dbname-$backup_time.sql.gz"
			  else
				  echo "database $dbname backup fail!"
			  fi
			  
		  done
	  else
		  echo "ERROR: No database to backup! backup stop"
		  exit
	  fi
	   # If you open the delete expired backup, delete operation
	  if ["$expire_backup_delete"=="ON" -a "$backup_location"!=""]; then
		  # `find $backup_location/-type d -o -type f -ctime + $expire_days-exec rm -rf {} \;`
		  `find $backup_location/ -type d -mtime + $expire_days | xargs rm -rf`
		  echo "Expired backup data delete complete!"
	  fi
	  echo "All database backup success! Thank you!"
	  exit
	fi


Modify shell script attributes:

	chmod 600 /root/mysql_backup.sh
	chmod +x /root/mysql_backup.sh

Set attributes, add the command crontab, we set up regular automatic backups every day 00:00, then the backup script directory/var/www/mysql directory is set to rsync synchronization.

	00 00 *** /root/mysql_backup.sh

## MySQL Recovery

Earlier MySQL backup into hot backup and cold backup, hot backup main purpose is to be able to recover in real time, such as an application server hard disk failure occurred, then we can modify the database configuration file read and write into slave so that you can minimize the time interrupt service.

But sometimes we need to perform a cold backup of the SQL data recovery, as with database backup, you can import through the command:

	mysql -u username -p databse < backup.sql

You can see, export and import database data is fairly simple, but if you also need to manage permissions, or some other character set, it may be a little more complicated, but these can all be done through a number of commands.

## Redis backup

Redis is our most used NoSQL, its backup is also divided into two kinds: hot backup and cold backup, Redis also supports master/slave mode, so our hot backup can be achieved in this way, we can refer to the corresponding configuration the official document profiles, quite simple. Here we introduce cold backup mode: Redis will actually timed inside the memory cache data saved to the database file inside, we just backed up the corresponding file can be, is to use rsync backup to a previously described non-local machine room can be achieved.

## Redis recovery

Redis Recovery divided into hot and cold backup recovery backup and recovery, hot backup and recovery purposes and methods of recovery with MySQL, as long as the modified application of the corresponding database connection.

But sometimes we need to cold backup to recover data, Redis cold backup and recovery is actually just put the saved database file copy to Redis working directory, and then start Redis on it, Redis at boot time will be automatically loaded into the database file memory, the start speed of the database to determine the size of the file.

## Summary

This section describes the application of part of our backup and recovery, that is, how to do disaster recovery, including file backup, database backup. Also introduced different systems using rsync file synchronization, MySQL database and Redis database backup and recovery, hope that through the introduction of this section, you can give as a developer of products for online disaster recovery program provides a reference solution.

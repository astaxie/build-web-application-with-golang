# 14.1 Static files

As we have already talked about how to deal with static files, this section we detail how to set up and use in beego static files inside. By then introduce a twitter open source html, css framework bootstrap, without a lot of design work we can let you quickly create a beautiful site.

## Beego static files and settings to achieve

Go's net/ http package provides a static file serving, `ServeFile` and `FileServer` other functions. beego static file processing is handled based on this layer, the specific implementation is as follows:

	//static file server
	for prefix, staticDir := range StaticDir {
		if strings.HasPrefix(r.URL.Path, prefix) {
			file := staticDir + r.URL.Path[len(prefix):]
			http.ServeFile(w, r, file)
			w.started = true
			return
		}
	}

StaticDir is stored inside the corresponding URL corresponds to a static file directory, so handle URL requests when the request need only determine whether the address corresponding to the beginning of the process contains static URL, if included on the use http.ServeFile provide services.

Examples are as follows:

	beego.StaticDir["/asset"] = "/static"

Example. Then the request url `http://www.beego.me/asset/bootstrap.css` will request `/static/bootstrap.css` for the client.

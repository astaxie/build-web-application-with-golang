# 2 Go basic knowledge

Go is a compiled system programming language, and it belongs to the C-family. However, its compilation speed is much faster than other C-family languages. It has only 25 keywords... even less than the 26 letters of the English alphabet! Let's take a look at these keywords before we get started.

	break    default      func    interface    select
	case     defer        go      map          struct
	chan     else         goto    package      switch
	const    fallthrough  if      range        type
	continue for          import  return       var
	
In this chapter, I'm going to teach you some basic Go knowledge. You will find out how concise the Go programming language is, and the beautiful design of the language. Programming can be very fun in Go. After we complete this chapter, you'll be familiar with the above keywords.

# 4.6 Summary

In this chapter, we mainly learned how to process form data in Go through several examples like logging in users and uploading files. We also emphasized that verifying user data is extremely important for website security, and we used one section to talk about how to filter data with regular expressions.

I hope that you now know more about the communication process between client and server.

# 10.4 Summary

Through this introductory chapter on i18n, you should now be familiar with some of the steps and processes that are necessary for internationalizing and localizing your websites. I've also introduced an open source solution for i18n in Go: [go-i18n](https://github.com/astaxie/go-i18n). Using this open source library, we can easily implement multi-language versions of our web applications. This allows our applications to be flexible and responsive to local audiences all around the world. If you find an error in this open source library or any missing features, please open an issue or a pull request! Let's strive to make it one of Go's standard libraries!

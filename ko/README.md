***Build Web Application with Golang***
======================================

### Purpose

Because I'm interested in web application development, I used my free time to write this book as an open source version. It doesn't mean that I have a very good ability to build web applications; I would like to share what I've done with Go in building web applications.

- For those of you who are working with PHP/Python/Ruby, you will learn how to build a web application with Go.
- For those of you who are working with C/C++, you will know how the web works.

I believe the purpose of studying is sharing with others. The happiest thing in my life is sharing everything I've known with more people.

# 7.7 Summary

In this chapter, we introduced some text processing tools like XML, JSON, Regexp and we also talked about templates. XML and JSON are data exchange tools. You can represent almost any kind of information using these two formats. Regexp is a powerful tool for searching, replacing and cutting text content. With templates, you can easily combine dynamic data with static files. These tools are all useful when developing web applications. I hope that you now have a better understanding of processing and displaying content using Go.
